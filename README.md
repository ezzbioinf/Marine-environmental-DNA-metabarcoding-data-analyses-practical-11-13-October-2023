# Marine environmental DNA metabarcoding data analyses practical, 11-13 October 2023

## Structure of the practical
The practical will be divided up by days (1-3). We'll hold the 3rd day for the complete case study 

Each day we will work towards our end goal of recapitulating the results of our chosen studies. But remember, our goal is to learn along the way, not to get to the end. Instead, we take our time on the journey that reaches the final results.

One of the most essential skills in computation biology/informatics is the effective sourcing of reference material. I.e. good googling!

As such throughout the 3/4 days, while you will be given a structure to follow, you will also be asked to work out how to do certain tasks independently. But don't worry, the practical support team will be there to help you when you get stuck. Much of what you're asked to do will be new to you and may feel challenging - that's totally normal.

NU staff will support the trainee with a computer in which all necessary software/tools are installed. However, you can install the required tools on your PC using
