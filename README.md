# Marine environmental DNA metabarcoding data analyses practical, 11-13 October 2023

## Structure of the practical
The practical will be divided up by days (1-3). We'll hold the 3rd day for the complete case study 

Each day we will work towards our end goal of recapitulating the results of our chosen studies. But remember, our goal is to learn along the way, not to get to the end. Instead, we take our time on the journey that reaches the final results.

One of the most essential skills in computation biology/informatics is the effective sourcing of reference material. I.e. good googling!

As such throughout the 3/4 days, while you will be given a structure to follow, you will also be asked to work out how to do certain tasks independently. But don't worry, the practical support team will be there to help you when you get stuck. Much of what you're asked to do will be new to you and may feel challenging - that's totally normal.

NU staff will support the trainee with a computer in which all necessary software/tools are installed. However, you can install the required tools on your PC using 
these guides for [DNA Barcoding analysis](https://github.com/ezzbioinf/Marine-environmental-DNA-metabarcoding-data-analyses-practical-11-13-October-2023/wiki/DNA-Barcoding-analysis,-Tools-setup-and-raw-data#tools-setup) and [eDNA metabrcoding analysis](https://github.com/ezzbioinf/Marine-environmental-DNA-metabarcoding-data-analyses-practical-11-13-October-2023/wiki/eDNA-metabrcoding,-Tools-setup-and-test-data#tools-setup)

Moreover, you can use https://gitpod.io for the command-line tasks in that practical. GITPOD allows you to launch and enter Virtual Machines from your browser and gives you 50 free hours per calendar month, enough for these sessions.

Therefore, you MUST do the following steps before completing this form to ensure you can start a GITPOD workspace.

It will take a few minutes each to set up a GitHub account and to set up a GITPOD account:

1. Click on this [LINK](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ezzbioinf/Marine-environmental-DNA-metabarcoding-data-analyses-practical-11-13-October-2023) in any desktop web browser (Note: Chrome seems to work better than Safari on a Mac desktop)

2. It will ask you to sign up with a GitHub account. If you don't have one, please get one at https://github.com/

3. Once you are signed in to GitHub.com, click the gitpod.io link above again. It will try to launch a GITPOD workspace using your GitHub login. You can give GITPOD permission to access your GitHub account - it's safe and only asks for email info. Follow the GITPOD prompts to ensure you are a real human and won't misuse their resources. When it asks you to connect your LinkedIn, you can skip that - you will still get 50 hours :-)

4. GITPOD will ask you to select which code editor and which machine size to start. The defaults are fine.

6. Once the GITPOD workspace starts (in less than a minute), you will see the following in your desktop web browser: a file browser on your left, a text editor top right, and a linux terminal bottom right.

After you've done this, go to gitpod.io/workspaces to delete any running workspaces (in green) so that you don't waste your 50 hours per month :-)

Last but not least, Here are links to tutorial hand-outs for each practical session, Enjoy training.
